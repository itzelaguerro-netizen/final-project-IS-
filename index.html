            <h1>'Wicked - Part One' Breaking Box Office Records </h1>
            <h2>The Highest Grossing Movie Ever Based on a Broadway Musical</h2>
            <img src="images /wicked.jpeg" alt="picutre of wicked movie poster">
            <br>
            <p> Wicked: Part One follows Elphaba, a brilliant but misunderstood girl born with green skin, as she
                arrives at Shiz University and unexpectedly becomes friends with the popular and privileged Galinda.
                Despite their differences, the two bond deeply until a trip to the Emerald City changes
                everything—Elphaba discovers that the Wizard she admires is responsible for the oppression of talking
                Animals. When she refuses to support his plans, the Wizard turns the public against her, forcing her to
                flee and accept the reputation of being “wicked.” Galinda, torn between ambition and loyalty, chooses to
                stay within the Wizard’s circle, setting the two friends on separate paths as the story ends with their
                relationship fractured and the world of Oz reshaped by their choices.</p>

            <p> Top 5 musical to Movie adaptains with Box office records 2024</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Wicked - $634 Million </li>
                <li> Mamma Mia - $611 Million </li>
                <li> Les Miserables -$442 Million </li>
                <li>Grease - $396 Million</li>
                <li> Chicago - $306 Million</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The film Wicked opened with a historic box-office weekend, earning about $112.5 million in the U.S. and
                Canada and roughly $164.2 million worldwide in its first days. This debut made it the biggest opening
                ever for a movie based on a Broadway musical, surpassing previous adaptations and giving it the
                strongest start of any non-sequel film released in 2024. Industry analysts highlighted how unusual it
                was for a musical to outperform major franchise films during a holiday release frame.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>As its run continued, Wicked surged to more than $700 million globally, combining approximately $460.6
                million domestically with $240.4 million internationally. This milestone officially made it the
                highest-grossing Broadway musical adaptation in film history, overtaking long-standing leaders like
                Mamma Mia!. After its theatrical wave, the movie continued breaking records by generating $70 million in
                its first week on digital release in the U.S. and Canada — the biggest first-week digital revenue ever
                for its studio.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Beyond the numbers, Wicked became a cultural moment celebrated in interviews, cast discussions, and early
                awards chatter. It was named Best Film of 2024 by the National Board of Review, while director Jon M.
                Chu received the Best Director honor — marking the first time a fantasy musical had earned that
                distinction. Across interviews, the cast and creators credited its success to its emotional themes, star
                power, and its blend of spectacle and nostalgia that drew in audiences well beyond traditional
                musical-theater fans.</p>
